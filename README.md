# Static Code Analysis for Python â€“ A graphical representation of Pylint & SonarQube

This project collects the code analysis results from two different tools, Pylint and
SonarQube, and provides a meaningful interface that can be used to analyze
the software quality of projects. 

It contains two applications, representing the backend and frontend parts of the tool:
- `pylint-findings-service` - provides and API with CRUD operations on the issues database. Handles all the backend requests over the database data.
- `frontend-app` - consists of the user interface which provides ways to configure and analyze projects and presents graphically the issues detected, allowing users to manipulate them.

MongoDB Cloud is used for storing the application data.
